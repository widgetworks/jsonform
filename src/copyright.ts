/**
 * @fileoverview Core of the JSON Form client-side library.
 *
 * Generates an HTML form from a structured data model and a layout description.
 *
 * The library may also validate inputs entered by the user against the data model
 * upon form submission and create the structured data object initialized with the
 * values that were submitted.
 *
 * The library depends on:
 *  - jQuery
 *  - the underscore library
 *  - a JSON parser/serializer. Nothing to worry about in modern browsers.
 *  - the JSONFormValidation library (in jsv.js) for validation purpose
 *
 * See documentation at:
 * http://developer.joshfire.com/doc/dev/ref/jsonform
 *
 * The library creates and maintains an internal data tree along with the DOM.
 * That structure is necessary to handle arrays (and nested arrays!) that are
 * dynamic by essence.
